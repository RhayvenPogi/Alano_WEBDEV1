    <h3>Song by Thee Sacred Souls</h3>
    <p>
        Can I call you Rose? (Can I call you Rose?) <br>
        'Cause you're sweet like a flower in bloom<br>
        (Can I call you Rose?)<br>
        Can I call you Rose? (Can I call you Rose?)<br>
        'Cause your fragrance takes over the room, darling<br>
        (Can I call you Rose?)<br>
        <br>
        I wanna plant you in my heart, oh<br>
        So love can grow<br>
        <br>
        Can I call you Rose? (Can I call you Rose?) <br>
        'Cause your thorns won't let love in too soon <br>
        (Can I call you Rose?) <br>
        Can I call you Rose? (Can I call you Rose?) <br>
        'Cause your roots have the power to consume me <br>
        (Can I call you Rose?) <br>
        <br>
        I wanna plant you in my heart, oh-oh <br>
        So love can grow<br>
        <br>
        I was meditating on love and you and roses <br>
        And the universe told me, "Put it in a love song" <br>
        <br>
        (Put it in a love song, put it in a love, put it in a love song) <br>
        Oh, Rose <br>
        (Put it in a love song, put it in a love, put it in a love song) <br>
        Oh, Rose <br>
        (Put it in a love song, put it in a love, put it in a love song) <br>
        (Put it in a love song, put it in a love, put it in a love song) <br>
        Won't you let me in your heart? <br>
        (Put it in a love song, put it in a love, put it in a love song) <br>
        Your heart <br>
        (Put it in a love song, put it in a love, put it in a love song) <br>
        Oh, your heart <br>
        (Put it in a love song, put it in a love, put it in a love song) <br>
        (Put it in a love song, put it in a love, put it in a love song) <br>
        <br>
        Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh<br>
        Ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
    </p>
